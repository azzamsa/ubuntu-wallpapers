# Ubuntu Wallpapers

## Why

I used to spend hours (~3h) browsing *Unsplash*, *Wallhaven*, and *Reddit* whenever I wanted a new wallpaper.
Instead of endlessly searching for the “perfect” one, I thought why not just pick from curated collections?

Back when I first used Ubuntu (2013), it came with some really nice wallpapers. But finding and browsing them  wasn’t easy, since the repository was tucked away on Launchpad.

So, I gathered them all here, organized by release, and made previews available. So you don’t have to download the entire repo just to choose a few.
